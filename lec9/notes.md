# 1) Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Short definition:**
A module, class, or function should have **one and only one reason to change**. In other words, each unit should do one job and do it well.

### Why SRP matters (long explanation)

Think of SRP as **modularity** and **separation of concerns**:

* **Cohesion**: Each module/function should have closely related responsibilities. High cohesion means the pieces inside a module belong together.
* **Low coupling**: Modules should depend on each other as little as possible. This makes changes local and safe.
* **Maintainability**: If one unit has a single reason to change, you can modify it without worrying about many unrelated side effects.
* **Testability**: Small single-purpose units are easy to test.
* **Reusability**: A unit doing one thing is more likely to be reused elsewhere.

### Real-world analogy

Imagine a kitchen appliance that is a blender + toaster + radio all in one. If the toaster breaks, you must send the whole appliance for repair. If appliances were single-purpose (one toaster, one blender), repair and replacement are simpler. SRP is the idea of one appliance = one job.

### Example in JavaScript / React (bad vs good)

**Bad (violates SRP):** a React component that fetches data, formats it, and also handles complex UI interactions.

```jsx
// BadComponent.jsx — does too many things
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function BadComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/items')
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  function format(items) {
    // complicated formatting logic
    return items.map(...);
  }

  // also handles filtering, sorting, and many UI responsibilities
  return (
    <div>
      {/* big UI + logic + formatting all in one */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Good (follows SRP):** split responsibilities into smaller units.

* A `useFetch` hook handles data fetching.
* A `formatItems` utility formats data.
* A `ListView` component renders UI and accepts formatted data.

```jsx
// useFetch.js — single responsibility: data fetching
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;
    setLoading(true);
    fetch(url)
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(d => { if (!cancelled) setData(d); })
      .catch(e => { if (!cancelled) setError(e); })
      .finally(() => { if (!cancelled) setLoading(false); });
    return () => { cancelled = true; };
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

// ListView.jsx — single responsibility: render a list
import React from 'react';
export default function ListView({ items }) {
  return <ul>{items.map(i => <li key={i.id}>{i.name}</li>)}</ul>;
}

// Parent component ties them together
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from './useFetch';
import ListView from './ListView';
import { formatItems } from './utils';

export default function Page() {
  const { data, loading } = useFetch('/api/items');
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  const items = formatItems(data);
  return <ListView items={items} />;
}
```

**Key takeaways for SRP**

* Keep modules small and focused.
* One module → one responsibility.
* If you find `if`/`else` blocks handling many unrelated responsibilities, consider splitting.
* SRP improves readability, maintainability, and makes collaborative work easier.

# 2) Custom Hooks (explain with examples with or without custom hook)

### What is a custom hook?

In React, a *custom hook* is a JavaScript function whose name starts with `use` and which can call built-in hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`). Custom hooks extract and reuse stateful logic across components.

They are not special APIs; they are a **pattern** for sharing logic.

### Why use custom hooks?

* **Avoid duplication**: If multiple components need the same logic, put it in a hook.
* **Readability**: Move complex logic out of components, leaving only the UI concerns in components.
* **Testability**: Hooks can be tested separately (with libraries like React Testing Library + testing utilities for hooks).

### Example: Without a custom hook

Two components need data fetching, and we duplicate the fetch logic.

```jsx
// Posts.jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
export function Posts() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => { fetch('/api/posts').then(r=>r.json()).then(setPosts); }, []);
  return (<div>{posts.map(p => <div key={p.id}>{p.title}</div>)}</div>);
}

// Comments.jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
export function Comments() {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => { fetch('/api/comments').then(r=>r.json()).then(setComments); }, []);
  return (<div>{comments.map(c => <div key={c.id}>{c.body}</div>)}</div>);
}
```

Notice: both components duplicate fetching logic.

### Example: With a custom hook (`useFetch`)

Extract fetching into `useFetch` and reuse it.

```jsx
// useFetch.js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;
    setLoading(true);
    fetch(url)
      .then(res => {
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        return res.json();
      })
      .then(json => { if (!cancelled) setData(json); })
      .catch(err => { if (!cancelled) setError(err); })
      .finally(() => { if (!cancelled) setLoading(false); });
    return () => { cancelled = true; };
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

// Posts.jsx
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from './useFetch';

export function Posts() {
  const { data: posts, loading } = useFetch('/api/posts');
  if (loading) return <div>Loading posts...</div>;
  return <div>{posts.map(p => <div key={p.id}>{p.title}</div>)}</div>;
}

// Comments.jsx
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from './useFetch';

export function Comments() {
  const { data: comments, loading } = useFetch('/api/comments');
  if (loading) return <div>Loading comments...</div>;
  return <div>{comments.map(c => <div key={c.id}>{c.body}</div>)}</div>;
}
```

Now both components are much lighter and we have one place to fix fetch logic.

### When not to create a custom hook

* Small one-off logic used in only one place — keep it local in the component.
* Avoid premature abstraction — when in doubt, duplicate once or twice, and refactor once you see repetition.

### Best practices for custom hooks

* Start the name with `use` (e.g., `useAuth`, `useForm`, `useLocalStorage`).
* Keep hooks composable and small.
* Return data and callbacks, not JSX.
* Handle cleanup inside the hook when subscribing to external sources.

# 3) What is chunking, code-splitting, dynamic bundling?

These three terms are related to how your application JavaScript is packaged and delivered to users.

### Bundling (quick primer)

A bundler (Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Vite) takes all your JS/CSS/images and creates one or more *bundle* files (e.g., `bundle.js`) that browsers download and run.

### Chunking

* **Chunk** = one output file produced by a bundler. A chunk contains some modules your app needs.
* During build, the bundler may output several chunks instead of one big file.
* Examples of chunk types: `main` (application code), `vendor` (libraries like React), `runtime` (small code needed to load other chunks), `lazy-xxxx` (dynamically loaded parts).

**Why chunk?** So the browser can download smaller files and load only what’s necessary.

### Code-splitting

* **Code-splitting** = the technique of splitting your codebase into multiple bundles/chunks that can be loaded on demand.
* **How you do it**:

  * **Static entry points**: multiple entry files lead to multiple bundles.
  * **Dynamic imports**: `import('./MyHeavyComponent')` — bundler makes a separate chunk for that module.
  * **Route-based splitting**: each app route loads a different chunk.
* **Benefits**: smaller initial bundle, faster first load, better caching (unchanged chunks remain cached).

**Example (React):**

```js
// dynamic import — creates a separate chunk for MyHeavyComponent
const MyHeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyHeavyComponent'));
```

### Dynamic bundling (term clarification)

* This term is less standardized, but you can think of **dynamic bundling** as the practice or system that **generates or delivers bundles tailored to runtime conditions**:

  * Example: Delivering different bundles for mobile vs desktop, or different feature flags, or generating bundles per-route on the server.
  * Tools/techniques: server-side rendering that references specific chunks, runtime chunk manifests, or micro-frontends that provide separate bundles per team.
* In short: dynamic bundling includes code-splitting + build/runtime strategies that produce bundles optimized for different scenarios.

### Common patterns / techniques

* **Vendor splitting**: move third-party libraries (React, lodash) into a separate vendor chunk.
* **Route-based splitting**: split by route so the code for `/admin` is not in the initial bundle for normal users.
* **Component-based splitting**: lazy-load heavy components (e.g., charts).
* **Prefetching & Preloading**: ask the browser to download chunks in the background (`webpackPrefetch: true`) so they’re ready when needed.

### Webpack magic comment example

```js
// This tells webpack to name the chunk "profile-chunk"
const Profile = React.lazy(() => import(/* webpackChunkName: "profile-chunk" */ './Profile'));
```

---

# 4) How all these help optimize our code

These techniques contribute to performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

### Performance benefits

* **Smaller initial payload**: Users download less JS on first load → faster First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI).
* **Parallel downloads**: Multiple smaller files can be downloaded in parallel (HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 help a lot here).
* **Better caching**: If vendor code is in its own chunk and rarely changes, it stays cached between deployments.
* **Perceived performance**: Loading a small shell quickly and lazy-loading non-critical parts makes the app feel faster.

### Developer benefits

* **Faster rebuilds**: smaller modules and chunks can speed development tooling (HMR, watch builds).
* **Better structure**: route/component splitting encourages modular design.

### UX benefits

* **Progressive loading**: show skeletons or minimal UI first, then progressively load heavy features (charts, maps).

### Measurable metrics improved

* **FCP (First Contentful Paint)** — improves with smaller initial JS/CSS
* **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** — can improve if large components are lazy-loaded
* **TTI (Time to Interactive)** — improves when main thread has less JS to execute at load
* **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** — can be kept low with good lazy-loading strategies and reserved space for elements

# 5) What is lazy loading (on-demand loading)?

**Definition:**
Lazy loading (or on-demand loading) is the technique of **deferring the loading of resources (code, images, data)** until they are needed by the user, rather than loading everything up front.

### Everyday analogy

When reading a book, you don’t carry every encyclopedia inside it — you only open chapters you need. Lazy-loading is opening the chapter when you need it.

### Types of lazy loading

* **Code modules/components** (React `React.lazy` + `import()`)
* **Images** (`<img loading="lazy">` or IntersectionObserver)
* **Data** (fetch details when the user expands a row)
* **Fonts / assets** (load only when a particular page is visited)

### React example (code splitting + lazy loading)

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
const Heavy = React.lazy(() => import('./Heavy'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading heavy component...</div>}>
        <Heavy />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* `React.lazy()` makes a separate chunk for `./Heavy`.
* When `<Heavy />` first renders, React automatically loads the chunk and shows the fallback until it arrives.

### Image lazy-loading example

```html
<img src="hero.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="hero image" />
```

### When to lazy-load

* Large components (charts, maps, editors)
* Routes that are not part of the initial user flow
* Rarely used features

# 6) Problems with lazy loading & solutions with Suspense (and examples)

Lazy loading improves performance but introduces some problems. Below we list problems and solutions.

### Problem A — Loading blank / flicker / layout shift

When you lazy-load a component, until it loads the UI might be empty or cause layout shift.

**Solution:**

* Use **Suspense fallback**: show a meaningful loader or skeleton to reduce flicker and communicate progress.
* Reserve space for the component (CSS height/width) to prevent layout shift.

**Example**

```jsx
// Good: show skeleton and reserve space
<Suspense fallback={<div style={{height: 300}}>Loading chart...</div>}>
  <LazyChart />
</Suspense>
```

### Problem B — FOUC (flash of unstyled content) or missing critical UI

If critical UI is lazy-loaded, user sees nothing. Don’t lazy-load UI that’s required on initial render.

**Solution:**

* Only lazy-load non-critical parts. Keep shell and essential controls in the initial bundle.

### Problem C — SEO and SSR issues

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) relies on sending HTML from the server. Lazy-loaded client-only components might not exist on the server, hurting SEO and first paint.

**Solution:**

* For SSR, use frameworks / libraries that support SSR + code-splitting (Next.js, Remix, or libraries like `@loadable/component` for SSR-aware code-splitting). These tools ensure the server knows which chunks to include.
* Or render a server-friendly fallback on the server and hydrate the lazy content on the client.

### Problem D — Error while loading chunk (network failures)

A lazy load can fail (network error, offline). If not handled, the app may crash or stay stuck.

**Solution:**

* Use an **Error Boundary** to catch the error and show a retry button. React’s `Suspense` does not catch errors; use an Error Boundary layered around it.

**Error Boundary + Suspense example**

```jsx
// ErrorBoundary.jsx
import React from 'react';
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { error: null };
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { error };
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>Something went wrong loading the feature.</p>
          <button onClick={() => window.location.reload()}>Retry</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// App.jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import { ErrorBoundary } from './ErrorBoundary';
const LazyFeature = React.lazy(() => import('./Feature'));

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading feature...</div>}>
        <LazyFeature />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### Problem E — Waterfall loads and repeated network requests

If a lazy component fetches many dependencies in sequence, the network can become a waterfall, increasing time to interactive.

**Solution**

* Optimize chunk dependencies (avoid deep nested dynamic imports).
* Preload or prefetch important chunks when you detect the user will need them soon (e.g., on hover of a link, prefetch that route's chunk).

**Example: prefetch on hover**

```jsx
// pseudo-code for route link hover prefetch
function PrefetchLink({ to, onHover }) {
  return <a href={to} onMouseEnter={() => import('./routeChunk') /* triggers prefetch if supported */}>Go</a>;
}
```

### Problem F — Hydration mismatch in SSR + lazy

Hydration mismatch occurs when server-rendered HTML doesn't match client-rendered content because lazy components were omitted on the server.

**Solution:**

* Use SSR tooling that supports detecting chunk usage on the server and includes them in the HTML. Or render stable fallbacks on the server and hydrate the real component on the client.

### Suspense for Data Fetching (advanced)

React's `Suspense` was initially designed for code-splitting, but React is evolving the idea for data fetching as well (`suspense for data`) — allowing components to *suspend* while data loads and letting the parent fallback show a UI.

This pattern needs libraries that implement Suspense-friendly data fetching (like React Cache patterns, Relay, or libraries that provide Suspense support). For stable production uses, use established frameworks and follow their docs.

---

## Full Practical Example: Route-based lazy loading with fallback + error boundary

**File structure (simplified)**

```
src/
  App.jsx
  index.jsx
  pages/
    Home.jsx
    Dashboard.jsx  (heavy)
  components/
    ErrorBoundary.jsx
```

**App.jsx**

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';
import ErrorBoundary from './components/ErrorBoundary';

const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
      </nav>
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading page...</div>}>
          <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={<Home/>} />
            <Route path='/dashboard' element={<Dashboard/>} />
          </Routes>
        </Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

* When a user visits `/`, only `Home` code is loaded. When they click `/dashboard`, the app loads that chunk on demand and shows the fallback while it downloads.

---

## Quick best-practices checklist

* **SRP**: keep modules & components focused and small.
* **Custom hooks**: extract reusable stateful logic into hooks (start with `use`).
* **Code-splitting**: lazy-load heavy or infrequently-used parts (routes, widgets).
* **Prefetching**: prefetch probable next-chunks to reduce wait.
* **Fallbacks**: always provide Suspense fallback UI and reserve layout space.
* **Error handling**: wrap lazy-loaded parts with Error Boundaries.
* **SSR**: use SSR-aware code-splitting tools for server-side rendering.
* **Measure**: monitor FCP, LCP, TTI, and bundle sizes.

## Further reading and next steps (suggested practice)

1. Try splitting your app route-by-route using `React.lazy` + `Suspense`.
2. Create a `useFetch` custom hook and replace duplicated fetch logic.
3. Measure performance before and after split with Lighthouse.
4. If you use SSR, read about frameworks like Next.js and about `@loadable/component` for SSR-safe code-splitting.

---

If you want, I can now:

* provide a copy-paste ready mini project scaffold (Vite or Parcel + React) showing these patterns; or
* produce an even more detailed writeup for **each code snippet** (line-by-line explanation).
